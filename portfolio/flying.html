            <p>This product is designed to highlight the importance of play in office environments. Restricted to using a single
                sheet of A3 to form a flying product, I decided to focus the design on assisting creative interaction between
                employees. I settled on designing a product for an office space wherein collaboration is key. After
                experimenting with flight to figure out the effects of weight, size and form, I designed simple graphics for the
                increments of the ruler and protractor, with this design predicated on the universality of the centimeter, inch
                and degree.

        <p>Looking at toy paper planes, through prototypes I figured out the elements of the planes that enabled flight.
            Namely, the way weight is disributed at the tip and the relationship between length, width and
            paper type. During this process I was sketching the possibilities of the form with these parameters in mind.

        <p>Moving from left to right, the left most product is a ruler, measuring 1-15cm. Then, there is a ruler that
            measures inches from 1-5. The next is a protractor that measures up to 10 degrees in 1 degree increments.
            Last, a protractor that measures up to 30 degrees in 10 degree increments. The prototypes as shown above
            provide rough measurements. They are meant to be used as helpful tools to indicate scale and position for
            those sketching in the office. The case shown below allows the set to be stowed away when not in use and
            provides a clear indication of the purpose of each instrument. </p>
