                Designing a journey for the user that moulds to the flexibility of the weather, in a group of four, we designed a
                waterproof jacket for those with cerebral palsy.

            <p>We began with a wide brief to protect anything or anyone against
                any weather. By constantly watching the people around us, we started to look for the patterns in behaviour during
                the daily experience of the weather here in London. Through observation, we were trying to discern where the problem was. 
                Though most people own jackets and umbrellas, the weather was changing so
                frequently that they werenâ€™t bothering to stop to put them on. We found the dip in the user experience of weather protection:
                the initial act of engaging with the product. </p>

                We began to think about those people for whom it takes longer to put on a waterproof jacket. We thought of people
                carrying children, wheelchair users, those with arthritis and those with cerebral palsy. Reaching out to Scope
                UK,
                the disability and equality charity in the UK, we spoke with a representative from the charity who has
                quadriplegic
                CP and my partner who has diplegic CP. Over the course of the project, we learnt which aspects of a jacket
                further
                complicate the processes of putting on and taking off the garment for those with CP.

                After multiple prototypes and meetings alongside the user group, we made a final proof-of-concept prototype and a draft final pattern. Which are now both being tested by the user group.
