            <p>This wireframe is part of a larger project I am working on. I am developing a framework which would allow 
                independent musicians to pay a one-off fee to own their own website with personal control over content management. 
                Currently, there are only social media sites or websites with ongoing management responsibilities from the website developer. 
                which in turn occur costs from the client. I am designing a framework using the Google Sheets API to act as a database from which 
                a static website is built in real time. Currently, I am working with musicians to wireframe the websites they want to understand what 
                will be required of my framework.

        <p> LINTD is the frontman of GOMID, a Manchester-London duo which I work closely with in the studio and also in my research. I designed his website 
            to mimic the forests in which he sets many of his projects: mysterious, dark places in which secrets are kept. In the HTML I hope to create a maze-like 
            link system from his projects, creating a website you could almost get lost in.
