                In a team of four, we are designing a projection mapping commission for the STEM Pod public science education
                centre at QMUL,
                <a href='https://www.centreofthecell.org/'>Centre of the Cell</a>.
                We are designing and animating an educational projection mapping film for the
                Centre of the Cell which is the first educational centre in the world located within biomedical
                research laboratories, attracting thousands of visitors each year.

            As the team of designers, we are collaborating with techincal engineers, project managers and the 
            founding team at The Centre of the Cell. On visiting the centre, we were set the 
            initial brief to design a projection mapping with a timeless style to add to the whole experience
            as the visitors filter in. However, we realised the mapping needed not add to the experience but simply 
            highlight what is already there. We needed to draw attention to the mysterious pod structure in the room 
            and add to the tension and mystery that begins the experience. Along this process, we were constantly 
            coding and drawing animations to demonstrate our visions.

            Currently, we have storyboarded the whole film (excerpts shown above) and are now undertaking the animation.
            We aim to deliver the project for the summer visitors.
