            As a designer, I am user-focused and
            a keen collaborator. My process revolves around conversation, 
            and learning to design empathetically, alongside the user. 
            <!-- experiencing what a design can become when it is a product of many minds. -->
            I look for the dip in a user's experience of a product
            and explore the root of the problem in order to design solutions.

            I am looking for a part-time position, to design in a 
            professional landscape. 
            I currenlty live in London and could move to Europe as of Summer 2024. 
        </p>

            You can see more of a scramble of design and music
            on my Instagram, and my previous experience on my CV below.  
            Feel free to get in touch for collaborations.
