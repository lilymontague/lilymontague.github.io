            <p>For an exhibition in The Tower by Hackney Central Station in August 2020, I used HTML and CSS to design
                a website to accompany the exhibition. The website was accessible for the duration of the exhibition 
                through a QR code and held all the information about the works.

        <p> This was the first time The Tower was used for an exhibiton so each work had to leave no trace in the space. 
            I was commssioned to make the website to avoid have to use adhesive to display information on the walls. I worked
            with the curators to design a website that fitted their needs and reflected the exhibition as a whole.
